	      <p>Gavriela is honored to uphold the vulnerable and healing framework of massage therapist and client. Instead of imposing her own rhythm, she carefully follows the subtle cues of each clientâ€™s breath, allowing the body to be the guide. She understands massage as a way to connect with the untouched landscapes of the psyche just as much as it is a tool to unlock holding patterns in the soma.
        </p>


<p>While she acknowledges the mysticism and intimacy of her profession, she also takes an unswervingly practical approach to her work. Her detailed understanding of anatomy, pain relief and injury prevention come from her education at Arbor College School of Massage, her yoga teacher training at the Asheville Yoga Center and her certification in personal training from the National Academy of Sports Medicine. </p>
