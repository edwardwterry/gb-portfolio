	      <p>As a massage therapist, I am endlessly fascinated by the human body and how it reflects our lived experiences. I use my curiosity about anatomy to get granular with pain relief. I put together subtle cues in order to discover and care for muscles that are carrying too heavy a burden. I utilize clinical massage techniques including trigger and tender point release to enable my clients greater comfort, range of motion, and physical freedom. 
        </p>


<p>I believe that every therapeutic relationship is based on mutual respect and genuine care. Finding the right massage therapist-client fit is essential to the healing process and I work best with people who are curious and present participants. I respond swiftly and sensitively to client communication and understand it as being crucial to the safety and efficacy of my work. 
</p>

<p>I enjoy working with clients from all walks of life. My areas of specialization include working with PTSD and trauma survivors, clients in eating disorder and addiction recovery, neurodivergent individuals, and people with disabilities. 
</p>

<p>I did my massage training at Arbor College School of Massage in Knoxville TN. Prior to that I attended Asheville Yoga Centerâ€™s 200 hour RYT yoga teacher training and went on to get further education in trauma-informed and nervous system informed yoga. I applied these skills as a yoga teacher and caregiver for people with disabilities. I earned my BA in Anthropology from Bard College. </p>
