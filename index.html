	      <p>I am a student massage therapist based in Knoxville, TN. I apply my background in mindfulness meditation and yoga to create a deep, subtle and flowing experience focused 
on healing and resetting the nervous system. I am passionate about providing focused pain relief by utilizing clinical massage techniques including trigger and tender point release. </p>

<p>I believe that every therapeutic relationship is based on mutual respect and genuine care. Finding the right massage therapist-client fit is essential to the healing process and I work best with people who are curious and present participants. I respond swiftly and sensitively to client communication and understand it as being crucial to the safety and efficacy of my work. </p>

<p>I enjoy working with clients from all walks of life. My areas of specialization include working with PTSD and trauma survivors, clients in eating disorder and addiction recovery, neurodivergent individuals, and people with disabilities. </p>

<p>I am currently attending Arbor College School of Massage. Prior to that I attended Asheville Yoga Centerâ€™s 200 hour RYT yoga teacher training and went on to get further education in trauma-informed and polyvagal-informed yoga. I applied these skills as a yoga teacher and caregiver for people with disabilities. I earned my BA in Anthropology from Bard College with a focus in Gender and Sexuality Studies. I have been practicing mindfulness meditation for three years and have introductory training in Gendlin Focusing. </p>
